"Big data" to me refers to data that is so massive in size and varies in formats, that it requires more
powerful tools and applications than those we are so familiar with in order to store, process, and analyze
it.

My chosen book is “The Promise and Peril of Big Data” by David Bollier.  Bollier attended a conference held by the 
Aspen Institute Communications and Society Program where the impressive feats and potential pitfalls of Big Data 
were praised and discussed, and he provides an inside track here.  This sparked my interest because with the vast amount 
of positive and impactful applications and uses of Big Data, it can lead to questions of when does using data become 
tricky, questionable, or uneasy?  Is there a “boundary” for good and “not-so-good” uses of Big Data?

My chosen data set of interest is called “NFL Combine - Performance Data (2009 - 2019)”, which I found on Kaggle.  If you don’t watch gridiron football, the Combine is where college players are put through a series of performance tests under the supervision of coaches, scouts, and personnel from all the NFL teams.  Examples of some of the tests are the 40-yard dash, bench press, vertical jump, and throwing long passes, all varying according to the different positions (quarterback, running back, wide receiver, etc.)  I chose this data set because I am a big football fan and I’ve wondered how teams decide which players to draft and how, if at all, their combine performances might factor into those decisions.  Also, I think it would be interesting to try to perform clustering on all the players and identify the similarities between them.  Did they have similar performance results? Are they centered around a certain draft position?
