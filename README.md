"Big data" to me refers to data that is so massive in size and varies in formats, that it requires more
powerful tools and applications than those we are so familiar with in order to store, process, and analyze
it.

My chosen book is “The Promise and Peril of Big Data” by David Bollier.  Bollier attended a conference held by the 
Aspen Institute Communications and Society Program where the impressive feats and potential pitfalls of Big Data 
were praised and discussed, and he provides an inside track here.  This sparked my interest because with the vast amount 
of positive and impactful applications and uses of Big Data, it can lead to questions of when does using data become 
tricky, questionable, or uneasy?  Is there a “boundary” for good and “not-so-good” uses of Big Data?
